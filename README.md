# Learning Python API Platform for Lithic (Privacy.com) By Joshua Sternfeld

> Deep Diving Lithic platform - Joshua Sternfeld - Technology Support Engineer (Candidate)

> I had a lot of fun learning your platform! 

## Installing / Getting started

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hammy414/lithic
main.py start
```

The main.py file will show you your shipment info. If you want to change package information, please edit the file to do so. 

## Initial Configuration

In order to run lithic, you need to have the library installed. I recommend using pip to easily install that into your directory. Please see below link for the lithic library install. 

You will also need a lithic token, this can be obtained by your dashboard. I used a sandbox token to do this for free. 

## Contributing

branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome.
